       <h3> expert on web design</h3>
       Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines <br/>
       in the production and maintenance of websites. 
       The different areas of web design include web graphic design;<br/>
        interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software;
         user experience design;
          and search engine optimization.<br/>
           Often many individuals will work in teams covering different
            aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.
            [1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe 
            the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website<br/>
             including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the 
             broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness <br/>
             of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected 
             to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines. 
     <h3> expert on CSE </h3>
     Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is an academic program <br/>
     at some universities that integrates the fields of computer engineering and computer science
     , providing knowledge of computing systems in both hardware and software design. <br/>
     The study program is modeled on German technical universities, where CS,
      CE and IT are treated as respectively the theoretical, <br/>
      technical and practical part of one field called "Informatik".

     Courses include computer architecture, processor design, operating systems,
      computer networks, parallel processing, embedded systems, circuit analysis,<br/>
       analog and digital electronics, computer graphics, cloud, web and mobile computing, 
       software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization,
        computer simulations and games programming.<br/>
         CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory
          of computation, design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, numerical analysis,<br/>
           machine learning, information theory, programming language theory and paradigms. 
           The program aims at designing, developing and troubleshooting <br/>
           computing devices and systems (such as personal computers, supercomputers, robots,
            smartphones, networking devices, embedded devices), focusing the underlying <br/>
            fundamental issues (like processor architecture design, operating system design
            , memory management, digital
